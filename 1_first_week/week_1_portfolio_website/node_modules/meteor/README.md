# Meteor

Meteor is an ultra-simple environment for building modern web applications.

With Meteor you write apps:

* in modern JavaScript
* that send data over the wire, rather than HTML
* using your choice of popular open-source libraries

Try a getting started tutorial:

 * [React](https://www.meteor.com/tutorials/react/creating-an-app)
 * [Blaze](https://www.meteor.com/tutorials/blaze/creating-an-app)
 * [Angular](https://www.meteor.com/tutorials/angular/creating-an-app)

Next, read the [guide](https://guide.meteor.com) and the [documentation](https://docs.meteor.com/).

## Quick Start

On Linux/macOS, install Meteor using:

```bash
curl https://install.meteor.com/ | sh
```

On Windows, first install [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/install), then run the following from using an admin command prompt:

```bash
choco install meteor
```

Create a project:

```bash
meteor create try-meteor
```

Run it:

```bash
cd try-meteor
meteor
```

## Uninstalling Meteor

Aside from a short launcher shell script, Meteor installs itself inside your home directory. To uninstall Meteor, run:

```bash
rm -rf ~/.meteor/
sudo rm /usr/local/bin/meteor
```

On Windows, follow [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/install)'s application uninstall process.
